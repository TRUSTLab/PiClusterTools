# PiClusterTools
Tools for Building and maintaining an educational Raspberry Pi Cluster

## History of the Project and Acknowledgements

The original idea for this project started in 2012 after reading about [a project at Boise State](http://coen.boisestate.edu/ece/raspberry-pi/) in which a PhD student named Joshua Kiepert assembled a [Raspberry Pi cluster](http://coen.boisestate.edu/ece/files/2013/05/Creating.a.Raspberry.Pi-Based.Beowulf.Cluster_v2.pdf) for his research.  A new professor at the University of Miami, I had been assigned the task of modernize the curriculum for EEN 312, their course on Microprocessors.  As both a fan of the Raspberry Pi, and out of a desire to engage the students with a real RISC architecture I built my own cluster with the help of my then graduate student, Alejandro Gutierrez.

Since the original cluster I've since begun building a set of scripts, images, and plans, to make it easier for others to replicate this work, incorporating the [hard work](https://darrenjw2.wordpress.com/2015/09/07/raspberry-pi-2-cluster-with-nat-routing/) of Professor Darren Wilinison of Newcastle University, along with my own modifications.

## Update Jan 15, 2016

I'm working to get a full, standalone, build that is easy to deploy.  This is still very much a work in progress in early alpha.
