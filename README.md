Tools for Building and maintaining an educational Raspberry Pi Cluster

## History of the Project and Acknowledgements

The original idea for this project started in 2012 after reading about [a project at Boise State](http://coen.boisestate.edu/ece/raspberry-pi/) in which a PhD student named Joshua Kiepert assembled a [Raspberry Pi cluster](http://coen.boisestate.edu/ece/files/2013/05/Creating.a.Raspberry.Pi-Based.Beowulf.Cluster_v2.pdf) for his research.  A new professor at the University of Miami, I had been assigned the task of modernize the curriculum for EEN 312, their course on Microprocessors.
